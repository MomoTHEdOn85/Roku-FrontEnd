## About  
One of Flashback's main usability features is the demarcation of the user profile. Users will be divided into two distinct categories; administrators (labeled; Parents) and Kids. Parents will have the ability to access all of Flashbacks' content and admin controls while 'Kids' will be limited to content pushed down from Flashbacks “kid-friendly content" protocol queries. Admin users will have the ability to customize settings being pushed down from Flashbacks CMS to provide a
unique viewing experience for their children. These features may include, but may not be exclusive to, such things as ratings, age appropriate (G, Family, PG, AA, A17) genres (rock, rap, country, jazz, classical, etc...), cartoons, live action, anime, etc

Some of the features of the app are:

- The parent profiles will be password protected. 
- Each profile can rate and comment on users’ selections as well as like and share.
- Saperate Kids profile that is only control by the admin not the user of the kids profile.
- Kids profile can also rate and comment on thier shows.
- Ability to save favourite shows, that could be displayed seprately in each user's profile.
- New arrival notifications.
